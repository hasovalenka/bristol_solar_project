# Calculating the solar potential for buildings in Bristol City, England, Part 2

A repository that shows how the Bristol Solar Team at the Open Data Bristol hackathon event (Nov 2018) estimated solar potential for buildings in Bristol and population potential for solar energy, England using open data (LiDAR - Environment Agency, Census) and open source tools (R,SAGA). 

This is second part of the analysis that has produced the estimates of solar irradiation and potential solar panel capacity and generation for buildings, street clusters, LSOAs and WARDs. Generalization of the estimates into 4 levels, helps to provide broader picture of the Bristol solar potential.

Additional, geodemographic open source data were used to provide population solar potential index. 

## Prerequisities

To run the code, you will need to have R installed. All required packages will be installed at the beginning of the rmarkdown.
